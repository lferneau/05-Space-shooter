Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/lferneau/05-Space-shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
By reviewing his repository I was able to find out how to add game sounds and music into the space shooter. 
For example I could use the specific lines in python to help out with any future games I want to incorporate music or sound into. 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I would love to be able to fluently add sound effects into my future games and projects.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I would say maybe to add more comments to help others that may use this repository or code.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Maybe some more could have been added in the READ.md that explained the problems they were experiencing more in depth.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
there was a phrase in line 94 that said "delta_time" and I was unfamiliar with that.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes it does.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
In the lines where he said that he had problems adding the victory theme into, I would say he should had added the specific lines just for easy finding.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
This was a very well written code. The addition of music and sound effects really made the game seem more proffesional.
I enjoyed the game and I liked how there was an end to the game as well.
